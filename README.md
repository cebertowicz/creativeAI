## About
In recent years, there has been an explosion of research and experiments that deal with Creativity and A.I. Almost every week, there is a new bot that paints, writes stories, composes music, designs objects or builds houses. Projects cover a wide range of disciplines — from machine learning, music, writing, art, fashion to industrial design and architecture. We call this phenomenon “CreativeAI”.

**CreativeAI.net** is a space to share CreativeAI projects. Countless links to CreativeAI Projects are floating around the web. It’s hard to keep track of these gems. CreativeAI.net attempts to solve this problem by offering a collaboratively curated feed of projects. Each project is conveniently presented as **Link + Media + Tags + Discussion**.
